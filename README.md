list of my mini python project just for fun

- [1] Find PI to the Nth Digit.
  Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- [2] Find e to the Nth Digit.
  Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- [3] Fibonacci Sequence.
  Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

- [4] Prime Factorization.
  Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

- [5] Credit Card Validator.
  Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).

- [6] Factorial Finder.
  The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.

- [7] Country from IP Lookup.
  Enter an IP address and find the country that IP is registered in. Optional: Find the Ip automatically.
