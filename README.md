list of my mini python project just for fun

- [1] Find PI to the Nth Digit.
  Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- [2] Find e to the Nth Digit.
  Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- [3] Fibonacci Sequence.
  Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

- [4] Prime Factorization.
  Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
