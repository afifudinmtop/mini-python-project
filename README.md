list of my mini python project just for fun

- [1] Find PI to the Nth Digit.
  Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- [2] Find e to the Nth Digit.
  Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- [3] Fibonacci Sequence.
  Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

- [4] Prime Factorization.
  Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

- [5] Credit Card Validator.
  Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).

- [6] Factorial Finder.
  The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.

- [7] Country from IP Lookup.
  Enter an IP address and find the country that IP is registered in. Optional: Find the Ip automatically.

- [8] Whois Search Tool.
  Enter an IP or host address and have it look it up through whois and return the results to you.

- [9] CAPTCHA Maker.
  Ever see those images with letters a numbers when you signup for a service and then asks you to enter what you see? It keeps web bots from automatically signing up and spamming. Try creating one yourself for online forms.

- [10] Caesar cipher.
  Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys
